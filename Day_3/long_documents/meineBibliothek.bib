In this mixture there is a possibility of tuning the Bose-Bose and Bose-Fermi interactions simultaneously using two well separated optical Feshbach resonances, and it is a good candidate to explore phase separation in Bose-Fermi mixtures. Depending on the Bose-Bose scattering length $a_\BB$, as the Bose-Fermi interaction is tuned the density of the fermions is pinched or swapping with bosons occurs.},

To test this approach, we examine thermodynamic properties of balanced three-dimensional Bose-Bose gases at zero and finite temperatures and find a good agreement with related works. We also study ground-state energies of repulsive Bose polarons by examining mixtures in the limit of infinite population imbalance. Finally, we discuss future applications of the FRG to novel problems in Bose-Bose mixtures and related systems.},

  abstract     = {The radiation pressure acceleration regime of laser ion acceleration requires high intensity laser pulses to function efficiently. Moreover the foil should be opaque for incident radiation during the interaction to ensure maximum momentum transfer from the pulse to the foil, which requires proper matching of the target to the laser pulse. However, in the ultrarelativistic regime, this leads to large acceleration distances, over which the high laser intensity for a Gaussian laser pulse must be maintained. It is shown that proper tailoring of the laser pulse profile can significantly reduce the acceleration distance, leading to a compact laser ion accelerator, requiring less energy to operate.},

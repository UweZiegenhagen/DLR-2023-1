# DLR-2023-1

Public materials for my Advanced LaTeX Course at the DLR


## Course Dates

* 31.07.2023
* 03.08.2023
* 07.08.2023
* 11.08.2023

Each date will consist of four hours, most likely from 10--12 and from 13-15.

## Necessary Prior Knowledge

This is not a course for first time users of LaTeX. You should have *some* 
at least basic experience with LaTeX.

## Topics

The final topics will be more or less fixated in the first session, we will
likely cover the following topics during the course.


* Writing letters and CVs
* Creating presentations
* Creating extended bibliographies
* Creating diagrams with TikZ
* Combining LaTeX and computing engines, e.g. Python
* ...

From the participants I received the following topics, which I grouped into areas:

### Programming LaTeX

* Designing my own layout (for beamer or other documents) 
* What tools do I need to have?
* What do certain commands mean, like for instance "\makeatletter"?
* Writing loops (like "if ... then ...")
* In general writing more involved environments. Here I know only the basics like \renewcommand or \DeclareMathOperator.
* Writing your own class and packages, and where should I save my own .cls or .sty files so that they are centrally available for all .tex files on my computer? 

### Taming LaTeX

* Forcing element (e.g. figure or footnote) positioning to be on specified page
* Maybe a more basic question is: How to get rid of "overful \hbox"?
* Using git-latexdiff (instead of latexdiff [options] old.tex new.tex > diff.tex and having to manually download old.tex)
* Strategy when managing a large project: what makes a 'good' LaTeX project? What are the dos-and-dont's (e.g. preamble in separate file, \input and \include, etc.) ?
* Is it actually possible to have absolutely no "underfull/overfull hbox" warnings? 
* Formatting footnotes to be positioned inside the running text at the bottom of the page (i.e. not below text but wrapped within text),
* Space between header numbering and header text
* Change between single column and multiple column style (e.g. abstract in single column, remaining content in twocolumn style)
* Custom abstract (abstract header, indentation, size, etc.) 


### Document Types

* Poster für eine wissenschaftliche Konferenz erstellen
* Präsentationen erstellen (wo liegt hier der Vorteil zu PowerPoint?)


### Bibliographies

* Custom reference and bibliography styles
* bib styles for entries that aren’t yet published
* An erweiterten Bibliotheken bin ich ebenfalls interessiert. Gerne auch in Kombination mit EndNote.

### Interactions 

* Die Analysesoftware die ich verwende ist R. Es wäre super etwas über die Kombination von LaTeX und R zu lernen
